    "introduction": "Welcome to the Heat Transfer Lab! Explore the core principles of heat transfer through a series of experiments. Determine thermal conductivity for solids (metal rod), liquids, and insulators, quantifying their resistance to heat flow. Investigate convection by calculating heat transfer coefficients in natural and forced scenarios, including composite walls and heat exchangers. Delve into radiation by measuring surface emissivity and verifying the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Finally, examine critical heat flux, a key phenomenon in boiling. This lab offers a practical understanding of conduction, convection, and radiation, and their applications in thermal systems.",
